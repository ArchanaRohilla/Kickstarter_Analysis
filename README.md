# Kickstarter Analysis

Kickstarter campaigns make ideas into reality. It’s where creators share new visions for creative work with the communities that will come together to fund them.

# Project Overview

In this project, an analysis has been conducted to answer the question and determine whether the length of a Kickstarter campaign contributes to its ultimate success or failure.

From the Kickstarter campaigns data analysis, we can say that the length of campaign contributes to its
ultimate failure in most of the cases where the duration of the campaign is more than 30 days. In other
words, most of the successful campaigns were having duration of 30 days or less. Also, the goal amount
plays a key role in the success or failure of the campaign. The lower the goal amount target the higher is
the chances of success. But some goal ranges like the one between $10000 to $25000 are susceptible to
both failure and success depending upon other factors.
The three conclusions from the analysis of the Kickstarter campaigns data based on the goals and launch
dates are:
1. From the data analysis of the outcomes based on goals, it is observed that the lower the amount
of the campaign goal higher is the chance of its success. For example, most of the successful
campaigns have the goal amount less than $5000.
2. Also, it can be observed from the data of the outcomes based on the goals that the higher goal
target increases its chances of failure. For example, the campaigns whose goal amount is more
than $45000 are more prone to failure. The campaigns whose goal amount ranges between
$10000 to $25000 have 50 percentage chances of either success or failure.
3. From the data analysis of the outcomes based on launch dates, it is observed that the most of the
successful campaigns were launched in the months of May and June. Where as in the month of
December the chances of success and failure were same (50:50).
The data given should consists of the status of the canceled projects whether they will be re-launched or
dropped forever. The status of the live projects is also not clear. We can also include some categories like
art, comics and fashion to broaden the area of coverage of the population of these Kickstarter Campaigns.
Also, we can include the columns like backer’s reward or share from profit making (successful) campaigns.
To have more in-depth analysis we can also include the ethnicity of the people to launch some specific
campaigns.
